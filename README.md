# Brain-Visualization-Tool

Tool to visualize epoched data in the time frequency domain. Functionality at this point includes:
-  Time domain peak identification and extraction
-  Time frequency decomposition using complex wavelet transform
-  Extraction of ROIs of time frequency decomposition 
-  Experimental: Wavelet filter using non-parametric statistic testing
